# testing_projects

this repository is all about testing projects, hence the name testing projects. Testing projects refers to two things: testing projects in github, and testing projects with pull requests/actions/such and such. This is even a test to figure out how this pull request business is supposed to go. So even if I fail Im technically succeeding because even a failed test is a sucessful test of what not to do.
